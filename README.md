## Abstract
Semantic segmentation has seen tremendous progress, yet the conventional closed-set paradigm severely limits its application in the open world. To overcome this, zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZSS) has emerged as a crucial research frontier, aiming to segment arbitrary objects described by language. A key challenge in this domain is how to effectively utilize these multi-scale features. To navigate this challenge, we propose ARS-CLIP}, a new framework that introduces a novel pre-decoding refinement stage.



## Implementation
TODO
